Sticky notes. Also ships a GNOME Shell extension under `extension/` and translations under `po/`.

## Stack

GTK 4.22 + libadwaita 1.9 via gtk4-rs 0.11 / libadwaita-rs 0.9, Rust edition 2021 (MSRV 1.80). `gio` is a direct dependency purely to raise the API level to v2_80 — leave it.

Crate is a lib + bin so integration tests and `examples/` can drive the real application rather than a copy of it.

## Commands

- `./test.sh` — fmt check, clippy with `-D warnings`, then `cargo test --all-targets`. Add `--headless` to run under Xvfb + a private D-Bus session. This is the gate; run it, not bare `cargo test`.
- **Never run `dbus-run-session` or `xvfb-run -a dbus-run-session` directly** — use `isolated-bus [--headless] -- CMD`. A private bus activates its own `xdg-document-portal`, which mounts over `/run/user/$UID/doc` and takes the login session's portal down with it when the bus exits; every flatpak on the machine then fails to launch until it is restarted. `test.sh --headless` guards against this internally, but one-off runs of a single test, or of the built binary, bypass it.
- `./install.sh` — release build, installs under `~/.local`. `./uninstall.sh` reverses it.
- `packaging/build-flatpak.sh` and `packaging/build-deb.sh` — distribution artifacts.

Widget tests need a display; model tests do not and are the bulk of the suite. `test.sh` sets `GTK_A11Y=none` and `GSETTINGS_BACKEND=memory` so tests never touch real user state — keep that true for anything new.

## Layout

`src/model/` is pure logic with no GTK types. `src/ui/` is widgets and the application. Read `DESIGN.md` and `README.md` before proposing structural changes; both are current.

## Conventions

- Use the `developing-gtk-apps` and `designing-gnome-ui` skills for widget, threading, and HIG decisions rather than deriving them again.
- Edit files with the Edit tool. Do not rewrite Rust sources through `python3 - <<PY` heredocs or `sed -i`.
- The sibling apps (brain, familiar, planner, youtube-downloader) share this layout and these scripts; a pattern established in one is the pattern here.
